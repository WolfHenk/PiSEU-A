THE SEU (Sende-Empfangs-Umsetzer) translates TW39 to ED1000 and vice versa

SEU-A was at "Amt" the networks side of the line. SEU-B was at the telex at costumers side.

This card emulates SEU-A and sits between raspberry Pi (piTelex) and a ED1000 and works as a kind of modem between piTelex TXD and RXD and Telex
